get_next_line(int file_descriptor, char **storage)
=============
Goal: Create a function that will read each line of a file, one after another, until there is no further data left to read.
Subgoal: Manage multiple file descriptors without losing your place in any of them.

If you are in or planning to be in 42, please reconsider looking at these files until you have completed this project for yourself.
